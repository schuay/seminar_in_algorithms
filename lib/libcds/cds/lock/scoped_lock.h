    /**

        An object of type \p scoped_lock controls the ownership of a lockable object within a scope.
        A \p scoped_lock object maintains ownership of a lockable object throughout the \p scoped_lock object’s lifetime.
        The behavior of a program is undefined if the lockable object does not exist for the entire lifetime
        of the \p scoped_lock object.
        The supplied \p Lock type shall have two methods: \p lock and \p unlock.

        The constructor locks the wrapped lock object, the destructor unlocks it.

        Scoped lock is not copy-constructible and not default-constructible.

        This class is similar to \p std::lock_quard
